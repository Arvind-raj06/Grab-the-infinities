# Grab-the-infinities

Hi all, I have been leading a hackerrank contest on behalf of my college. And I would like to add these for your reference which inturn help design some new question.

Thanks to Sriram, Nikkhil and Vignesh for helping out in defining problems and all my third year team who had been contantly working for the success.

We seperated each 2 problems prepared by me and Nikhil and one by Vignesh and one by Sriram.
