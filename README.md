# Grab-the-infinities

Hi all, I have been leading a hackerrank contest on behalf of my uniiversity. And I would like to add these for your reference which inturn help design some new question.

Thanks to Sriram, Nikkhil and Vignesh for helping out in defining problems and all my third year team who had been contantly working for the success.

We seperated each 2 problems prepared by me and Nikhil and one by Vignesh and one by Sriram.

All you need to do is start from the question GTI 893 and pass the clue given in custom test case and run the program to get some output and then use the answer you got from the program in clue finder to make sure that the found answer is correct or wrong.
Then if the answer is correct it will give you the next program code that you have to solve and the clue.
Continue until you finish all of this process and get a link.


Link to contest is as https://www.hackerrank.com/gti-finals

You can give it a try and add suggestions.
